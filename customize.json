You were glowing, absolutely stunning, and you deserved to hear that. Instead, my silence made you feel invisible, unappreciated, like I didn't even care. That breaks my heart because nothing could be further from the truth. Being miles apart already makes this so hard, and the last thing I ever want is for you to feel unloved by me. You are the most beautiful person in my world — not just how you look, but everything about you. The way you get excited about little things, the way you wanted to share that moment with me even from so far away... I should have told you right then that you took my breath away. I'm sorry I didn't. I promise you, Tanvi, I will never let you doubt how much I see you, how much I adore you, how much you mean to me. तू माझं सगळं काही आहेस. Please forgive me. I love you more than anything. 💕",
